## All the commits and changes that I've made during the entire process

07.04.2022: Added documentationl, insertion of the tree and input numbers from .txt file  
11.04.2022: Fixed typos mistakes, added first three traversals: inOrder, preOrder, postOrder 
14.04.2022: Fixed some bugs (traversals wouldn't work because the first node is always NULL and I didn't check if node was different than NULL), deleted numbers.txt from repository since I'm going to use random numbers generated by the compiler, added the last traversal, levelOrder traversal, changed MAXNODES constant to 20 as I'm going to add only 20 random nodes between 0 and 100, using srand() function     
**Project done!**
