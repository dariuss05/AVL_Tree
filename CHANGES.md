## All the commits and changes that I've made during the entire process

07.04.2022: Added documentationl, insertion of the tree and input numbers from .txt file  
11.04.2022: Fixed typos mistakes, added first three traversals: inOrder, preOrder, postOrder 
14.04.2022: Fixed some bugs (traversals wouldn't work because the first node is always NULL and I didn't check if node was different than NULL), added the last traversal, levelOrder traversal, changed MAXNODES constant to 20 as I'm going to add only 20 random nodes between 0 and 100, using srand() function     
**Project done!**
